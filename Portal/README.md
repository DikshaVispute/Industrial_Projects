# Portal

Portal is a backend class management system developed using **Java** and **Spring Boot**. It provides RESTful APIs for managing academic data such as students and courses, with **MongoDB** used for persistent storage. The application follows a layered architecture and all APIs are tested using **Postman** as the client. This project demonstrates backend development practices, REST API design, and NoSQL database integration.
